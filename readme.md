# Digit Recognition App  

This application is a tool for creating and training a neural network for the recognition of handwritten characters.

## Requirements

* AForge library, which can be downloaded [here](http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/downloads.html).
* MNIST database of handwritten characters, which can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Setup Tips

* Specify the number of neurons and levels of the neural network and click 'Create'. This will create a neural network.
* Select or type the directory with the training set and click ('Ok' or 'Choose')
* Clicking the 'Mix' button helps neural networks learn faster
* Select or type the directory with testing set and click ('Ok' or 'Choose')
* Enter training props and press the 'Train' button. The neural net training will begin. To display a learning progress chart, select Checkbox 'Chart'.
